# Analytics-of-Food-Prices-in-Pakistan-Information-mining-and-retrievall-
For the analysis of Pakistan food prices over time, we must process the 'wfp dataset. This dataset contains Food Prices data for Pakistan, sourced from the World Food Programme Price Database. The World Food Programme Price Database covers foods such as maize, rice, wheat, beans, fish, and sugar along with other non-food items like petrol/diesel prices and wages of non-qualified labor. This data is of utmost importance to researchers as it will help inform their work on finding solutions to the potential food price situation in Pakistan.
we must implement the latest machine and deep learning algorithms to achieve the highest accuracy and precision for this project.
Functional requirements achieved in this project:
1. Preprocessed the data by cleaning, normalizing, and transforming it into a suitable format for analysis.
2. Founded the general trend in food prices over time.
3. Analyzed the significant relationship between different food prices.
4. Analyzed the impact of increased oil prices on the prices of other food items.
5. Estimated the economic impact of a potential food raise over time to non-qualified labor..
6. Compared all provinces' data over time and founded general trends.
7. Developed policies to mitigate the impact of a potential food price according to food
groups.
8. Created a graphical user interface (GUI) to showcase all comparison results.
